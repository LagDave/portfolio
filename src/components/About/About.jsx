          <p className="mt-4">Hello! My name is Rustine Dave. I am a full-stack developer who loves to solve problems - <span className="text-green text-shadow-none">I eat them for breakfast!</span></p>
          <p>My flaming love for programming sparked at a very young age. I was on 6<sup>th</sup> grade when I realized how much I enjoyed creating complex logic. My love for music is also unmatched!</p>
          <p>I got my first web dev job when I was 16 and from then on, things has just gotten better and better for my career. Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege to deliver solutions on various companies in different industries harnessing my web skills I garnered throughout the years. I have a substantial experience working at  <span className="text-green">a digital marketing agency,  a startup, and  an outsourcing web development company</span>.</p>
